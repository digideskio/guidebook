<h4> How To Submit and Share Your Fonts</h4>
<p>
<a title="http://openfontlibrary.org/up" class="external text" href="http://openfontlibrary.org/up">Sign up</a>, then <a title="http://openfontlibrary.org/in?redirect=up" class="external text" href="http://openfontlibrary.org/in?redirect=up">sign in.</a><br>
Make sure you have all the font and source files, then
decide on the <a class="mw-redirect" title="License" href="[route]/guidebook/font_licensing">license</a> you want to use for the font files, and apply it to your font files.
<p>Ensure you <a title="How to name a font family (page does not exist)" class="new" href="/wiki/index.php?title=How_to_name_a_font_family&action=edit&redlink=1">named your font family</a> correctly
</li><li> Write a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Fontlog" href="/wiki/Fontlog">fontlog.txt</a>, giving a summary of the font family's history
</li><li> Create an attractive <a class="mw-redirect" title="Sample image" href="/wiki/Sample_image">sample image</a> to show off your fonts in use (PNG or JPEG)
</li><li> Finally, put all of the files (fonts, fontlog.txt and sample images) into a ZIP file
</li></ol>
<p>Then go to the <a title="http://openfontlibrary.org/submit/typeface" class="external text" href="http://openfontlibrary.org/submit/typeface">Share</a> form and give your font family a title, add some tags and a short description, and click the upload button. That's it!
</p><p>Remember, the fonts you upload will be immediately available for everyone to use. When you choose the license, you are declaring that the font files only contain things that
</p>
<ul><li> you hold the copyright for (usually because you designed them), or
</li><li> are licensed to you under a free software license, such as the Open Font License.
</li></ul>
<p>The Open Font Library stores your uploaded files in a <i>font family." The family keeps related font files together for ease of reference. For example, it could contain the regular, bold and italic variants, or it could contain a regular and a distorted variant. To give visitors easy access, it is best to add all the variants into one font family.</i>
</p><p>You can add the license to <a title="How to include a license inside font files with FontForge" href="/wiki/How_to_include_a_license_inside_font_files_with_FontForge">each font file itself easily with FontForge</a>. We recommend including as much <a title="Font metadata" href="/wiki/Font_metadata">font metadata</a> inside your font files as possible.
