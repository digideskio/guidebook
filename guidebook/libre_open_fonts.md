<h1>Libre/Open Fonts</h1>

<p>Libre/open fonts are about freedom, not price. 
</p><p>They are fonts you are:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>free to use</b> for any purpose
</li><li> <b>free to study</b> how they were made
</li><li> <b>free to improve</b>
</li><li> <b>free to redistribute</b> both exact and improved copies
</li><li> <b>free to embedded, subset, bundle and derive from to create any kind of artwork or document</b>
</li><li> '<i>free to do all of these things commercially</i> as it is about <i>freedom,</i> not price.
</li></ol>
<p>It is important to distinguish conceptually between a font and a typeface, as explained on the <a title="Vocabulary" href="/wiki/Vocabulary">vocabulary</a> page.
