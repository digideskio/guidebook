<h1>Guidebook</h1>

<h4>Hello, welcome to the Guidebook.</h4>
<p>Here you'll find an abundance of information that helps explain what <a href="/guidebook/libre_open_fonts">Free/Open Fonts</a> are, where to <a href="/guidebook/existing_libre_open_fonts">find them</a> (here at OFLB, of course), and how to <a href="/guidebook/knowledge_resources">make</a> <a href="/guidebook/font_formats">your</a> <a href="/guidebook/font_design">own</a>. 

<p>
But if designing fonts isn't your thing, you'll also find several pages that suggest other ways to get involved, like <a href="/guidebook/how_to_file_bugs>How To FIle Bugs</a>, <a href="/guidebook/become_a_translator">Become a Translator</a> and brush up on your <a href="/guidebook/book_recommendations">font knowledge</a> in general.

<p>
You can also help right here, suggesting ways to make the Guidebook better for the community.

<p>
Thank you,
OFLB community
