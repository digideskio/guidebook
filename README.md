<h1>Guidebook</h1>

<h4>Hello, welcome to the Guidebook.</h4>
<p>This is essentially a "How-to" guide for anything and everything you could possibly need or want regarding Open Font Library. To make things easy to digest, we separated all the pages into three categories: Contribute, Information and Technical. 

<p>The Contribute category offers everything you will need to know to get involved in Open Font Library. As far as designing fonts this includes: how to actually <a href="/guidebook/font_design">design a font</a>, what <a href="/guidebook/font_formats">formats</a> and <a href="/guidebook/supported_licenses">licenses are supported</a>, and how to <a href="/guidebook/submission_guidelines"> submit</a> and <a href="/guidebook/how_to_update_a_font">update</a> them when finished.
<p>
But if designing isn't your thing,  you can always help out by <a href="/guidebook/how_to_file_bugs"> filing bugs</a>, <a href="/guidebook/become-a-translator">becoming a translator</a> and <a href="/guidebook/dev-faq"> developing</a> for OFLB.
<p>
The Information section provides useful information for brushing up on general font knowledge. This includes <a href="/guidebook/book_recommendations">book recommendations</a>, <a href="/guidebook/knowledge_resources">knowledge resources</a>, and an explanation of what in the world <a href="/guidebook/libre_open_fonts">free/open fonts</a> actually are.

<p>
Lastly, the Technical section is for all you hardcore font designers. It's similar to the Contribute and Information categories, but everything in Technical is of a more thorough, specific nature. It features more complex information dealing with subjects like <a href="/guidebook/collaborative_design_workflows">collaborative design workflows</a>, how to install the open source font editor <a href="/guidebook/how_to_install_fon_forge">FontForge</a> and other <a href="/guidebook/software">software resources</a>, and the specifications of <a href="/guidebook/supported_licenses">supported licenses</a> and <a href="/guidebook/font_packaging">font packaging</a>.

<p>
We hope this helps. The Guidebook is meant to make your OFLB experience fun and successful. If it's failing in any way, please let us know - this will help make OFLB better for everyone involved.
