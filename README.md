<h1>Guidebook</h1>

<h4>Hello, welcome to the Guidebook.</h4>
<p>Here you'll find an abundance of information that helps explain what <a href="/guidebook/libre_open_fonts">free/open fonts</a> are, where to <a href="/guidebook/existing_libre_open_fonts">find them</a> (here at OFLB, of course), and how to <a href="/guidebook/font_design">make</a> <a href="/guidebook/font_formats">your</a> <a href="/guidebook/submission_guidelines">own</a>. 

<p>
But if designing fonts isn't your thing, you'll also find several pages that suggest other ways to get involved: <a href="/guidebook/how_to_file_bugs">how to file bugs</a>, <a href="/guidebook/become-a-translator">become a translator</a> and <a href="/guidebook/dev-faq">developer</a>, and ways to brush up on your general <a href="/guidebook/book_recommendations">font</a> <a href="/guidebook/knowledge_resources">knowledge</a>.

<p>
You can also help right here, suggesting ways to make the Guidebook better for everyone involved.

<p>
Thank you,<br>
OFLB Community
